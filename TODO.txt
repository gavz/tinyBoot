Current TODO list for tinyOS:

Functionality:

  - Interrupts:
    - Implement a GICv3 driver.
    - Only needed for virtio.

  - Memory Management:
    - Enable the MMU
    - Only enable in tBoot, not tinyROM.
    - Mappings:
      - R/W disabled in ROM region
      - tBoot region should only be R/W in EL3.

  - Backtrace
    - Look into how a backtrace can be implemented.
    - Hardware or software implementation.

  - Booting:
    - 'firmwareN' devices should only be registered if they have an image there.
    - All boot images should be wrapped in a tinyImage header.
    - Boot target support:
      - Linux
      - U-Boot
      - XNU
      - Memory (generic)

  - Command line tools:
    - bdev      -   view information of active block devices
    - bootdev   -   view information of active boot devices (and what they are)
    - serial    -   view information of active serial interfaces
    - bdinfo    -   view platform/board information

  - Secure Monitor
    - Outline design for secure monitor
    
  - Testing:
    - Memory management tests
    - Serial tests
    - Storage tests

  - Documentation:
    - Document various design aspects and implementation spec of the system:
      - Memory management
      - Drivers
      - Storage interfaces
      - Serial interfaces
